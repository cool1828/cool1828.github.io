      How to Create a Live Website
  </h1>
  <body>
    <p>
      By downloading Atom a code editor and by creating an account with github that holds millions of repos and files you are able to broadcast
      your own website live for various people to see. Github will host your website once you download github for desktop and link it to your
      account after creating your repo page being your username.github.io for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      You then must clone your github.io to your computer and open it in Atom and create a new file called idex.html.
      You can then type in your html in Atom which allows you to commit and sync any changes broadcasting your html live. These changes will be highlighted,
      displayed in your github desktop app showing what you have removed and what you have added after the sync. You can then type in your username.github.io
      into a web browser and there you will see your website live. Changes can be continuously made, it is recommended that you only sync when
      necessary.
